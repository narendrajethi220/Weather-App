## Getting Started

To use the Weather App, you'll need to sign up for a free API key from OpenWeatherMap:

1. Visit [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and sign up for a free account.
2. Once logged in, navigate to the "API keys" section to generate your personal API key.

3. Click the "Refresh" button to update the weather information.

## Configuration
